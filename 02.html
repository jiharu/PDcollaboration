# 3D in Photoshop
Reference: Gee, Zorana , 3D in Photoshop, Focal Press, 2013.   
Practice images from Elizabeth Viscomi (*Thanks for your beautiful drawings!*) 

# Practice: [creating 3D](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/book/animation-and-3d/9780240813776/3dot-getting-started-with-3d-in-photoshop/33_converting_to_3d?uicode=torontopl) 

There are at least five ways to take 2D images into 3D geometry. 

## Preparation
- Open Photoshop. Change the workspace into *3D* (menu: Window/Workspace/3D as in the image below)  
- Note: Save often so that you don't lose too much if your 3D file in Photoshop crashes.

## 1. 3D Postcard  
First open or draw a pixel based image. Then you can apply *New 3D Postcard from Layer* to create a 3D postcard, which you can move, rotate, scale, add lights, and render.

### Navigating 3D  
There are many 3D tools in Photoshop to help you manipulate your scene components (objects, meshes, cameras and lights) as well as tools that help with selecting and applying materials. The easiest way to manipulate positions of scene components is with the 3D-Axis Tool. Under the 3D Panel you can find a toolbox of 5 rotation-related tools.

## 2. 3D Shape from Preset

You can apply a 2D image as a texture to any of the preset Photoshop geometries.

## 3. 3D Repoussé Object

With vector drawings (Paths), Repoussé allows you to create 3D text, objects, and abstract elements in Photoshop (menu: 3D/Repoussé/Selected Path). 

![3d](img/02/3d05.png) 
Draw or open your vector image.  

![3d](img/02/3d06.png)   
Repoussé option window. 

![3d](img/02/3d07.png)   
You can change material properties.  

### Export as OBJ file

![3d](img/02/3d08.png)   

OBJ has it’s origins with Alias Wavefront, a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry — namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces that make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices.

- [Comparison II between OBJ & FBX](http://www.reallusion.com/iclone/help/3DXchange5/Pipeline/05_Export/The_Comparison_of_OBJ_FBX.htm)	

### Import to Meshlab

- [Download Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/#download)  

MeshLab is an advanced 3D mesh processing software system that is oriented to the management and processing of unstructured large meshes and provides a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering, and converting these kinds of meshes. MeshLab is free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later, and is used as both a complete package and a library powering other software. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeshLab)

## 5. 3D Volumes

A 3D Volume is generated with two or more layers. The volume is an interpolation between layers and not real 3D geometry. This means that no mesh is generated and you cannot apply many of the 3D capabilities to it. This is primarily important for medical professionals working with [DICOM images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) or frames where viewing a volume rendering is useful. However, there are interesting effects you can create by simply taking multiple layers (raster or vector) and interpolating between the pixels to generate a volume.

## Materials

Materials are important as they essentially define the appearance of the 3D object. Materials are made up of different properties that can be defined as a single value or a texture map that varies the value over the surface of the object.
