# Class 2: Image in world 
**Exploring the immaterial dynamics of virtual space and mixed virtual/physical space.**

## Theme 1: Spatial painting 

It is interesting to see how important painting in three dimensions has become to the recent resurgence of Virtual Reality (VR), such as the broadly acclaimed Tilt Brush, which allows artists to performatively paint with virtual brushes in surrounding space; a kind of life-size light-painting sculpture in which “your room is your canvas”. 
You are invited to explore painting & drawing in space, experimenting new expressions to explore what could be its new possibilities or limits. Approach it artistically and critically and examine your own expression.

## Theme 2: Body as canvas 

The image of the body (whether of an object, animal, alien, or a person) digitized, exploring transformations of space, time, and identity as a very personal and experiential play with self and individuality.

## Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.  
The output of photogrammetry is typically a map, drawing, measurement, or a 3D model of real-world object or scene. [http://www.photogrammetry.com/](http://www.photogrammetry.com/)

Shining360 is a 30-minute audio-visual experiment for VR derived from the physical space within Stanley Kubrick's film ‘The Shining.'  Using photogrammetry, 3D elements are extracted and extruded from the original film stills, and the subsequent fragments are stitched together and viewed along the original camera path.

## Practice: turn your 2D design into a 3D printed object
### 2D images
A **bitmap** is a representation of an image, consisting of rows and columns of pixels, that each store color information. Each pixel (picture element) contains a color value for a number of channels – usually red, green, and blue. When you view these channels together, at a high enough resolution, all of the different colored pixels form a complete image. These images can then be output to video, film, print, etc.

**Vector** images are not based on pixel patterns, but instead use mathematical formulas to draw lines and curves that can be combined to create an image from geometric objects such as lines, circles, triangles, squares, and other polygons. Vector images are edited by manipulating the lines and curves that make up the image using a program such as Adobe Illustrator.

Bitmap formats are best for images that need to have a wide range of color gradations, such as most photographs. Vector formats, on the other hand, are better for images that consist of a few areas of solid color. Examples of images that are well suited for the vector format include logos and text.

## 2D gray image to 3D using online apps
- [Shapeways app](https://www.shapeways.com/creator/2dto3d#landing) 

### Source: bitmap images such as .jpg or ,png. 

![2d3d src](img/07/giraffe-head-silhouette-clip-art-zebra.jpg)
This is the sourceimage as .jpg

![2d3d_shape](img/07/shapeways.png)

You can download the converted geometry as .x3db
And you can transfer this to more widely used geometry extension such as .obj or .stl using NetFabb Studio Basic. 

You can download NetFabb Basic [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/netfabb-basic/download/)

![2d3d shape nf](img/07/netfabb02.png)

Netfabb Studio Basic.

![2d3d shape nf01](img/07/netfabb03.png)

Once you have a geometry, you can combine, edit, and deform the object using your favorite software.

- [Selva 3D](http://www.selva3d.com/)

![2d3d shape sv01](img/07/selva.png)

You can transform 2D images into 3D models. However it is free only if you want to download low resolution geometry. From the below image, you can compare the result from 1. Shapeways to NetFabb and the result from 2. Selva3D.

![2d3d shape nf02](img/07/netfabb.png)

The first case: Shapeways to NetFabb

![2d3d shape sv](img/07/netfabb01.png)

Comparison between the first case and the geometry downloaded from Selva3D. Low quality is free but high quality stl data is not free from Selva3D.


## 2D gray image to 3D using Thinkercad
- [Thinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)  

The source image is .svg (a kind of vector graphic), and Thinkercad turns it into 3D geometry immediately.

![2d3d shape tc](img/07/thinkercad.png)

The dialog window pops up when you import an svg file.

![2d3d shape tc01](img/07/thinkercad01.png)

The dialog window pops up when you export the transformed geometry.

## Using Blender
### Source: vector image. 

To convert a 2D vector image into 3D using Blender your source image must be an .svg file.
Black and white silhouette designs work best.

### How:
- Prepare .svg silhouette vector image.
- From Blender, import the image.

![2d3d shape bl00](img/07/Chandelier.svg)
The source vector image as .svg.

![2d3d shape bl](img/07/bl01.png)

- Choose the imported object and scale it up. 

- From the right tool settings, choose the curve and add the Extrude value. It will define the height of the geometry. Then you can export the geometry with several different formats including .obj and .stl.
