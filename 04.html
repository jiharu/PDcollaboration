# AR Practice 
Creating **Augmented Reality (or VR)** with **AR.js** and **A-Frame**:   
This AR/VR method is simple, cross-platform, and open source for artist's practices!

	- [WebVR](https://webvr.info/)
		WebVR is an open specification that makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to get into VR experiences, no matter what device you have.

## AR.js
[AR.js](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/): Efficient Augmented Reality for the Web. It is marker based.

 ![ar](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/slides/artoolkit-aframe/images/hiro.png)

### Features
- **Very Fast:** it runs efficiently even on phones. 60 fps on the 2 year-old phone. 
- **Web-based:** It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Full javascript - based on three.js + jsartoolkit5
- **Open Source:** It is completely open source and free of charge!
- **Standards:** It works on any phone with webgl and webrtc. 

## A-Frame
A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. Originally from Mozilla, A-Frame was developed to be an easy but powerful way to develop VR content. As an independent open source project, A-Frame has grown to be one of the largest and most welcoming VR communities.

A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js.

A-Frame supports most VR headsets such as Vive, Rift, Daydream, GearVR, Cardboard, and can even be used for augmented reality. Although A-Frame supports the whole spectrum, A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360° content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers.

# Practice
## Codepen
> CodePen is a playground for the front end side of the web. Need to build a reduced test case to demonstrate and figure out a bug? CodePen is great for that. Want to show off your latest creation and get feedback from your peers? CodePen is great for that. Want to find examples of a particular design pattern for your project? CodePen is great for that. - [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/about/)

### Codepen set-up 

- Let's create an account. [codepen link](https://codepen.io/)
	
- Create a new pen. 

- There are three text boxes: HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript). Mostly we will only use the HTML box to enter code. Shrink the CSS and JS boxes to have a bigger space in the HTML box. 

- You may also want to open the browser console, where any errors will be printed. How to do this depends on what browser you use. E.g. in Chrome, it is under View / Developer > JavaScript Console. In Firefox it is Tools / Web Developer > Browser Console. [For other browsers click here.](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)

- Optional: you can disable Auto-Updating Preview under Behavior in the setting box. The Run button will appear at the top right pannel. (Sometimes auto-updating can be distracting or cause the browser to crash due to an infinite loop while you are typing.)

		A-Frame provides components for loading glTF, OBJ, COLLADA. We recommend using glTF if possible as glTF gains adoption as the standard for transmitting 3D models over the Web. 
		- [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/): efficient runtime 3D asset delivery. Portable 3D graphics transmission Format.  
glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.  
			- Compact to transmit.
			- Fast to load.
			- Describes full scenes. 
			- Runtime neutral.
			- Open and extensible.
