## Course description 

This course will explore hybrid and collaborative processes in digital art making. Students from various program areas will work together to broaden their visual language and develop experimental approaches to digital painting and expanded animation. Digital and traditional techniques, used in combination, will include stop-motion animation, projection, digital image editing, 3D rendering and animation, drawing tablets, installation, drawing and painting. In groups, students will apply these techniques and processes to the creation of compositional studies, installation experiments or visual research as well finished digital paintings, time-based and spatial interventions. Students with credit in DRPT-3B27 may not take this course for credit.

Especially this semester, students are invited to expand their canvas to multiple dimensions of 2, 2.5, 3, or higher as applying a concept of ***"image in world".*** We can achieve this goal by drawing and painting on the surface of 3d objects or in the air by moving body parts. Tilt brush is one example application which allows this new practice domain. Also students will explore dynamics of perspectives by artist movement which occur spectator's movement to experience their painting in virtual/digital space. 

## Course objectives

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:  
- expand upon their knowledge of digital applications and collaborative creative processes through demonstrations, group studio assignments and presentations.  
- develop analytical and critical skills to better understand contemporary digital work and contextualize their own studio practices.  
- deepen their knowledge of painting and animation theory through assigned readings and in-class discussions of critical texts.  
- create technically and conceptually innovative collaborative digital works at the advanced level.  
- further refine presentation and verbal skills within the classroom environment.  

## Course format

This class is highly practice based. One-third of the class will be lecture-based, showing theory and practice using presentation media and demonstration (33%). The other two-thirds will be supervised students’ hands-on practice (66%). 

### Supply
Students will be required to supply laptop, three button mouse or tablet pencil, and headphones (to follow web tutorials) in the class. Please also bring a notebook or small sketchbook and pencils to sketch and collect ideas.  

## Grade breakdown 
### Group assignment 55 %
- Initial presentation (10 %)  
- Progress presentation (15 %)  
- Final presentation (15 %)  
- Documentation (15 %) 
### Individual assignment 35 %
- Presentation (10 %)  
- Final presentation (15 %)  
- Documentation (10 %) 
### Participation 10%

### Assignment description:  

- **Group assignment:** based on a chosen reference of still life (painting or a photograph) with a scene construction, reconstruct via 3D modeling. Applying proper shaders with textures and cinematographic set-up including camera, lights, and shadows. Details will be announced in class. (30%)  
- **Final-term free-theme individual project:** 15 seconds completed animation along with one HD render image. More details will be announced in class. (30%)  
- **Assignments:** simple hands-on practices designed to help students’ progress following each 3D modeling & animation subtopic. Completion in time and proper targeting to the subject are the two evaluation criteria. (30%) 
- **Participation:** regular attendance and the student’s participation in research, making, listening, sharing, and participating in class activities. Also, it is expected that students will show a commitment to completing all projects and assignments with creative & aesthetic solutions based consistent work habits both in class time and outside of class time. 

## Evaluation criteria
- Quality of the work produced; with the balance of the student’s artistic expression & sensitivity as well as technical understanding, with integration of techniques and subject.  
- Ability to solve problems into the process of making.  
- The progress and engagement of the student in their research, and their curiosity and motivation to learn and achieve.  
- The degree and details to which students can set challenges for her or himself.  
- Commitment (includes participation, completing work on time)
