## Course description 

This course will explore hybrid and collaborative processes in digital art making. Students from various program areas will work together to broaden their visual language and develop experimental approaches to digital painting and expanded animation. Digital and traditional techniques, used in combination, will include stop-motion animation, projection, digital image editing, 3D rendering and animation, drawing tablets, installation, drawing and painting. In groups, students will apply these techniques and processes to the creation of compositional studies, installation experiments or visual research as well finished digital paintings, time-based and spatial interventions. Students with credit in DRPT-3B27 may not take this course for credit.

Especially this semester, students are invited to expand their canvas to multiple dimensions of 2, 2.5, 3, or higher by applying a concept of ***"image in world"*** and sub-themes of ***"spatial painting" & "body as canvas".*** We can achieve this goal by drawing and painting on the surface of 3D objects or in the air by moving body parts. *TiltBrush* is one example application which allows this new practice domain. Also students will explore dynamic perspectives by the movements of artists and the movements of spectators in virtual/digital space. 

## Course objectives

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:  
- expand upon their knowledge of digital applications and collaborative creative processes through demonstrations, group studio assignments and presentations.  
- develop analytical and critical skills to better understand contemporary digital work and contextualize their own studio practices.  
- deepen their knowledge of painting and animation theory through assigned readings and in-class discussions of critical texts.  
- create technically and conceptually innovative collaborative digital works at the advanced level.  
- further refine presentation and verbal skills within the classroom environment.  

## Course format

This class is highly practice based. One-third of the class will be lecture-based, showing theory and practice using presentation media and demonstration (33%). The other two-thirds will be supervised students’ hands-on practice (66%). 

### Supply
Students will be required to supply laptop, three button mouse or tablet pencil, and headphones (to follow web tutorials) in the class. Please also bring a notebook or small sketchbook and pencils to sketch and collect ideas.
